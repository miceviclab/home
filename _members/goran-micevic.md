Dr. Micevic completed his MD and PhD degrees at Yale School of Medicine. His doctorate focused on epigenetic changes in melanoma formation and progression with Dr. Marcus Bosenberg. He completed dermatology residency at Yale New Haven Hospital and dermatopathology fellowship. For his post-doctoral work, he joined the lab of Dr. Richard Flavell at the Yale Deparmtent of Immunobiology, where he investigated the immune cell populations required for long-term response/anti-tumor memory in the setting of checkpoint inihibitor therapy in melanoma. 

In 2024, he joined the Yale School of Medicine as an Assistant Professor of Dermatology to build a research group focusing on skin immunobiology of chronic inflammatory skin diseases and melanoma, to better understand how individual immune cells orchestrate skin inflammation in benign and malignant conditions. His current work focuses on the immuno-epigenetics in cutaneous melanoma, and developing better treatment modalities for patients with melanoma. As a physician scientist with a strong interest in skin immunology, he sees patients suffering from cutaneous malignancies, and also has a general interest in chronic inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis, alopecia areata and psoriasis.
