## Welcome to the Micevic Lab!

{% capture text %}

Our group is broadly interested in melanoma epigenetics and with specific interests in identifying epigenetic mechanisms regulating anti tumor immunity and functio.   Using mouse models, single cell approaches (scRNA-Seq, ATACseq), genetic perturbation tools (CRISPR) and clinical tissues samples, the group aims to lay the foundation for the next-generation of cancer immunotherapies.
